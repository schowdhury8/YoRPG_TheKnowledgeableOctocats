## Protagonist Subclasses
### Scout
A **fast** and hard-hitting, but **brittle** class. 
### Heavy
A **strong** warrior capable of taking and dishing out a lot of damage, but can fall quickly **without defensive assistance**.
### Medic
A **healer** class that is not capable of doing much damage, but is imperative in providing defense and healing to teammates. 

## Monster Subclasses
### Spy
A **fast** and **sneaky** class that can skillfully take out opponents, but will surely **perish if attacked alone**. 
### Pyro
A **maniachal** creature that can annihilate anything in its way, until it is cut short by a well-coordinated opponent team.
### Engineer
A **defensive** class that has no chance in the battlefield, but is instrumental in the team's victory from behind the scenes, providing support and healing through its **engineering proficiency**.

If anyone hasn't noticed yet, these characters are based on Valve's *Team Fortress 2*.

##Extra Features
These wild monster types can now be encountered in the game! 
Also, it was difficult to know how close we were to dying without being able to see our health, so we added that functionality in as well!

##How to Play

2. Run YoRPG
3. Try to beat all the monsters and win the game!
